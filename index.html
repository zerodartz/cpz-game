<h1>The Awakening</h1>
<p>You slowly open your eyes, blinking away the haze of a deep slumber. As your vision comes into focus, you realize you're lying on a cold metal floor in a dimly lit room. The air is stale and carries an acrid scent you can't quite place.</p>

<p>With a groan, you sit up, your muscles aching from the hard surface. Looking around, you see banks of computer terminals lining the walls, their screens dark. A single fluorescent light flickers overhead, casting an eerie glow. </p>

<p>You have no memory of how you got here or what this place is. The last thing you remember is... actually, you can't seem to recall anything specific. It's as if your mind has been wiped clean.</p>

<p>Slowly, you get to your feet, steadying yourself against the wall. Your instincts tell you that you need to find a way out of here, to figure out what's going on. But where to start?</p>

<p>That's when you notice it - a small scrap of paper tucked underneath one of the terminals. You pick it up and unfold it. In bold green letters, it reads:</p>

<pre>
______ * ______ * ______
 find    the     key   
</pre>

<p>A cryptic clue. But at least it's something to go on. Your heart begins to race as you realize the gravity of your situation. You're trapped in an unknown location with no memory, and this message is your only lead. Time to explore and see what secrets this strange place holds...</p>
